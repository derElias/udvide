Known Bug:
When VWC respondes with anything else then 200 (201@POST) we currently throw an unrecoverable Error.
This includes 404 when a requested record is missing etc.
--> Error Handling needs improvments!!

I want to handle these errors costum:
403:TargetNameExists POST/PUT
404:UnknownTarget POST/PUT/DELETE
422:BadImage POST/PUT
422:ImageTooLarge POST/PUT
422:MetadataTooLarge POST/PUT
500:Fail --> retry

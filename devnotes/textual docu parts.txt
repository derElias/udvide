Requirements:
    PHP 7.1.5+ (lower could work but is not officially supported. e.g. PHP 7 should)
    PEAR
    HTTP_Response2
    a GD library (usually bundled with PHP) (you could expand the image support of the udvide system with this)
    a PDO driver for your Database (tested with InnoDB) (usually bundled with PHP)

To keep in mind:
    When switching PHP versions, keep in mind that the login system uses password_hash and sha1;

Who did what:
Everything realized in PHP including, but not limited by
the Database connector, the Vuforia API connector*, the Core Application,
the AJAX API, the Plugin Support, the FHWS Plugin and the Udvide-mobile-API
got written by me Simon Janssen if nothing else is explicitly noted, like HTTP_Response2 and the TMS Signature Builder, in a more local context.

*excluding the TMS Signature builder; inspired by the Samples provided by Vuforia

JS code, including the web-application, CSSs and HTML is written by Elias Riedel if nothing else is explicitly noted in a more local context except
the AJAX connection prototype, navigating server-sent resources and parts of DOM-Manipulation are partially written or inspired by Simon.

The Database DDL was written by Lukas Ziegle and Simon Janssen.
The Documentation about the Databases structure was written by Lukas Ziegler.

    Form submit: (ToDo make this a table)

        First we suggest that you take care of a few potential errors or performance issues
         when writing a client like this especially the fields targetName and image. e.g. duplicate names

        If you want to send Form submits to the System from your own site to create, update or delete entries,
         you have to follow the following requirements:
        Send a POST request to /.php as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        the submission must include certain values based on the operation you want to perform:

        1. You have to send your login credentials as following:
            A string username as 'username'
            A sha-256 hash string from your password as 'passHash'
        2. To specify the action you have to provide
            create, update or delete as 'udvideVerb'
        3. For deleting and updating you have to provide // ToDo: NOT UP TO DATE
            The respective Target ID as 't_id' (you get it from manage.php?rawGet=true) // ToDo
        4. For updating and creating you can include any of the following attributes: *tagged are necessary for create
            A string target name as 't_name'
            A JPG/PNG/... base64 encoded image as 't_image'
            A boolean to indicate weather the target should be active on creation as 'activeFlag'
            A integer for the map positions 'xPos'
            and 'yPos'
            and a (integer) map identifier 'map'
            A json string to define the content as 'content'
                It's syntax looks like this: ToDo a bit ambitious, but why not start a html inspired json standard // still subject of QA
                /** @lang=json */

                        },
                        {
                            "text" = "alternative text",
                            "img" = "http://example.com/image.png",
                            "lf" = "true"

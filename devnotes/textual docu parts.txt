    Form submit: (ToDo make this a table)
        If you want to send Form submits to the System from your own site to create, update or delete entries,
         you have to follow the following requirements:
        Send a POST request to /crudForm.php
        the submission must include certain values based on the operation you want to perform:

        1. You have to send your login credentials as following:
            A string username as 'username'
            A sha-256 hash string from your password as 'passHash'
        2. To specify the action you have to provide
            create, update or delete as 'udvideVerb'
        3. For deleting and updating you have to provide
            The respective Target ID as 't_id' (you get it from a Get on manage.php)
        4. For updating and creating you can include any of the following attributes: *tagged are neccessary for create
            A string target name as 't_name'
            A JPG/PNG/... image* as 't_image'
            A boolean to indicate weather the target should be active on creation as 'activeFlag'
            A integer for the map positions 'xPos'
            and 'yPos'
            and a (integer) map identifier 'map'
            A json string to define the content as 'content'
                It's syntax looks like this: ToDo a bit ambitious, but why not start a html inspired json standard // still subject of QA
